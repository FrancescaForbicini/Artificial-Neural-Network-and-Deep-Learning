In this homework, we classify species of plants, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

## Dataset
The dataset is divided in the following way:
  - Species1 : 186
  - Species2 : 532
  - Species3 : 515
  - Species4 : 511
  - Species5 : 531
  - Species6 : 222
  - Species7 : 537
  - Species8 : 508

## Results

Thanks to our model, we reached the following results:

| Metric            | Value   |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Accuracy          | 0.9283  |
| Species1 F1 Score | 0.8467  |
| Species2 F1 Score | 0.9219  |
| Species3 F1 Score | 0.9693  |
| Species4 F1 Score | 0.9199  |
| Species5 F1 Score | 0.9452  |
| Species6 F1 Score | 0.9615  |
| Species7 F1 Score | 0.9787  |
| Species8 F1 Score | 0.8852  |
