In this homework, we classify samples in the multivariate time series format. Since this is a classification problem, 
the objective is to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.

## Dataset
Time series shape: 2429x36x6
The number of classes is 12, which are:
  0. "Wish"
  1. "Another"
  2. "Comfortably"
  3. "Money"
  4. "Breathe"
  5. "Time"
  6. "Brain"
  7. "Echoes"
  8. "Wearing"
  9. "Sorrow"
  10.  "Hey"
  11.   "Shine"
