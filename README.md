# Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning

The course's major goal is to provide a theoretical background and the practical skills to understand and use NN, and at the same time become familiar and with Deep Learning for solving complex engineering problems.

Together with other two colleagues, I did two challenges of this course. The first one is about Image Recognition, while the other one is based on Time Series.
